        <p>Full Stack Web Developer with a background in the Financial industry transitioning careers bringing my experience in customer service and business analysis. I have worked for 11 years in the financial industry and intend to switch careers and work as a full stack web developer bringing with me my experience in customer service and business analysis.</p>

        <p>My time working in the financial industry had me in demanding sales roles where I achieved success with persistence, optimism and the willingness to adapt. In the last few years I have worked in a corporate environment that dealt with specialized projects that all ran simultaneously, had overlapping deadlines requiring extensive conflict resolution, time & project management skills along with collaboration and leadership skills. My success is reflected in being recognized as top performer once a quarter in the last 3 years.
        </p>
          
        <p>A recent graduate of the University of Toronto's Full Stack Web Development & Coding Boot Camp with a certificate where I honed my skills in JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. This along with my extensive sales and analyst experience makes me an ideal candidate for a web developer.</p>
